# QueryPDF

**QueryPDF** is a local-first, terminal-based RAG tool that allows users to interact with PDF documents using natural language, entirely offline. It extracts text from user-specified pages, chunks it intelligently, embeds the content, and stores it in a local vector database. Then, using an LLM served by Ollama, it provides accurate, grounded responses to your queries ‚Äî all without any internet connection.

## üîç Features

- **Privacy**: All processing happens on your machine, no data leaves your system.
- **Local Caching**: Caches both tokenizers and embedding models locally for offline use and faster future runs.
- **Interactive Page Selection**: Specify which pages to analyze at runtime.
- **Graceful Exit Handling**: Automatically cleans up ChromaDB collections on exit.
- **Visual Progress Feedback**: Shows embedding generation progress.
- **Context-Aware Responses**: Uses semantic search to find the most relevant chunks for your questions.
- **Fully Customizable**: Users can configure embedding model, LLMs, and chunk parameters via a simple JSON file.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

| Technology | Purpose |

## ‚úÖ Requirements

* Python 3.10+
* Ollama  
  - Install Ollama and run:  
    ```bash
    ollama run gemma3:1b
    ```

## üì¶ Installation

Create a virtual environment using:

```bash
python -m venv <environment-name>
```
Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
./<environment-name>/scripts/activate
```
Install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install pypdf transformers sentence-transformers langchain chromadb ollama colorama yaspin
```

Or using `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üìÇ Project Structure

```
project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.json         # Configuration file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.py              # Main script
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sample.pdf          # Example PDF for testing
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt    # Package dependencies
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md           # Documentation
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The application uses a `config.json` file with the following parameters:

```json
{
    "embedding_model": "intfloat/e5-small-v2",
    "ollama_model": "gemma3:1b",
    "chunk_size": 450,
    "chunk_overlap": 100
}
```

You can modify these settings to adjust:
- The embedding model used for semantic search (you can find embedding models on [hugging face](https://huggingface.co/)) .
- The Ollama LLM model used for response generation as per your requirements and resources (you can find ollama models on [Ollama github page](https://github.com/ollama/ollama)) .
- Make sure to install the required LLM model by running ```ollama run <model-name>``` in the terminal -- This installs the model locally .
- Chunk size and overlap for text splitting as per the model .


## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

1. Run the script:

```bash
python app.py
```

2. When prompted, paste the full path to your PDF file:

```
Paste the PDF path: /path/to/your/document.pdf
```

3. Enter the page range you want to analyze:

```
Enter the page range (e.g., 15-25): 10-20
```

4. The application will process the PDF, extracting text, generating embeddings, and storing them in ChromaDB.

5. Enter your questions when prompted:

```
Chat with PDF: What is the main topic discussed in the document?
```

6. To exit the application, type:

```
Chat with PDF: /exit
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **PDF Extraction:** Extracts text from specific pages based on user input (you specify the page range during runtime).

2. **Tokenization & Chunking:** Uses the specified tokenizer to split the text into chunks of configurable size (default: 450 tokens) with customizable overlap (default: 100 tokens).

3. **Embeddings:** Creates embeddings for each chunk using SentenceTransformers (default: `intfloat/e5-small-v2`).

4. **Vector Storage:** Stores the embeddings and original text chunks in a local ChromaDB collection.

5. **Chat Interface:** Accepts user queries, retrieves the top 3 most relevant chunks, and feeds them into an Ollama-served LLM (default: `gemma3:1b`) for response generation.

## üìÅ Local Model Caching
To ensure full offline capability and improve performance, QueryPDF automatically saves required models locally:

- üß† **Tokenizer**: On first run, the Hugging Face tokenizer (transformers.AutoTokenizer) is downloaded and saved to a local_tokenizer/ directory. Subsequent runs will use this local tokenizer even without an internet connection.

- üî§ **Embedding Model**: The embedding model (e.g., intfloat/e5-small-v2) is saved locally under local_e5_small_v2/ on the first run. If the model is already cached, it will be reused without redownloading.
